# OC Swapper

A basic tool I threw together in a few hours to swap between SteamVR and OpenComposite DLL binaries quickly. Mostly to distribute with my Tahrovin Wabbajack modlist as a way to make it easier for users to choose and remove the need for them to root around in the game folders.

Pretty much everything important is stored in the local `config.ini` file. OC Swapper uses MD5 hashes as something quick and dirty but common enough to not be totally flawed. Could I use something better? Probably. 

I'll need to do a proper write up for this at some point, I guess.

OC Swapper is MIT licenced, do whatever you want with it. If you can do a much better job than me, please send me a link! I am merely a self-taught C# scrub :^)
